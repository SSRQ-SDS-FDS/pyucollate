Pull requests are very welcome although for sizable tasks it may be worth
discussing via a GitHub issue before undertaking too much work.

All tests, including flake8 should pass and code coverage should stay at 100%.

If you have any problems, questions or suggestions, please file an issue on
GitHub.
